# Documentation Strategy

- **Proactive Maintenance**: Whenever adding libraries, changing architecture, or establishing new patterns, **immediately** update (or propose updates to) `.agent/` documentation. Do not wait for the user to ask.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Keep `.agent/architecture.md`, `.agent/rules/`, and other docs as the authoritative reference for the project state.
